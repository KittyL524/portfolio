            <h2 class="section-title">MY ROLE</h2>
            <p> In this project, my main role was to create visual assets, including character designs, scenes, 
                UI elements, and 3D models. I also collaborated with my group members to develop a compelling 
                storyline and gameplay mechanics.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">CONCEPT</h2>
            <p> "Undertaker" is a third-person, turn-based strategy (TBS) game, introducing a unique hybrid 
                combat system, blending real-time action with traditional turn-based mechanics to enhance game 
                pacing. This approach provides a more dynamic and engaging experience compared to conventional 
                turn-based games. Players engage in real-time dodging to accumulate energy and plan strategic 
                attacks, creating a fast-paced and exciting gameplay experience.</p>
            <p> The core objective of the game is to purify the soul by overcoming the emotional burdens 
                accumulated throughout a lifetime. Players explore a fantasy world, uncover hidden memories, 
                and face enemies through hybrid combat while solving puzzles to reveal 
                the protagonist’s backstory. </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">PROCESS</h2>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <p> We initially designed a narrative-driven puzzle exploration game with three branching endings 
                based on player choices. As we developed multiple storyline paths, we realized that relying 
                solely on dialogue led to an overwhelming amount of text. To ease the cognitive load, I 
                implemented narrative clues through visual elements embedded in the scenes.</p>
            <p> Additionally, I learned the importance of establishing consistent relative sizing between 
                character sprites and scene objects before making a demo. Because this was not defined from 
                the start, we later spent significant time adjusting and replacing assets to maintain visual 
                coherence.</p>
            <div class="project-image-container">

            </div>

            <p><strong>Illustrate</strong></p>
            <p> I craeted the inital character draft in Proceate. I craeted the visual assets of sprites 
                and animtions by Aseprite. For character design, I created the "Light Bulb Monster,
                " an enemy concept closely tied to the game’s narrative. Drawing from the protagonist's 
                last scene before a car accident—an overexposed truck headlight—I combined light bulb and 
                eye motifs to symbolize the trauma embedded in the subconscious. The enemy was designed 
                with a humanoid head, incorporating bloodshot thread-like elements around the bulb to evoke 
                the image of bloodshot eyes, aligning with the game’s psychological horror theme.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
            <p> I enjoyed working on this project despite it being stressful and challenging. I learned a lot 
                in this project about game design and game work flow. I have a really good team in this project 
                that we make a good teamwork while we learned time management and problem solving. We know the 
                design should start from small idea based on our ability before develop it into a big idea.</p>
