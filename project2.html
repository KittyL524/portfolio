            <h2 class="section-title">MY ROLE</h2>
            <p> In this project, my main role was to create visual assets, including character designs, scenes, 
                UI elements, CG and 3D models. I also collaborated with my group members to develop a compelling 
                storyline and gameplay mechanics.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">CONCEPT</h2>
            <p> "Undertaker" is a third-person, turn-based strategy (TBS) game, introducing a unique hybrid 
                combat system, blending real-time action with traditional turn-based mechanics to enhance game 
                pacing. This approach provides a more dynamic and engaging experience compared to conventional 
                turn-based games. Players engage in real-time dodging to accumulate energy and plan strategic 
                attacks, creating a fast-paced and exciting gameplay experience.</p>
            <p> The core objective of the game is to purify the soul by overcoming the emotional burdens 
                accumulated throughout a lifetime. Players explore a fantasy world, uncover hidden memories, 
                and face enemies through hybrid combat while solving puzzles to reveal 
                the protagonist’s backstory. </p>

            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <p> The game was originally designed with fully 3D characters and environments. However, 
                during prototyping, we realized that the production scope exceeded our time constraints. 
                To ensure project completion while maintaining visual appeal, we blended 3D as base with 
                2D paper-cut art style inspired by Don't Starve.</p>
            <div class="project-image-container">

                <p class="image-caption">scenes screenshot</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Visual Asset</strong></p>
            <p> I created the initial character drafts, CG illustrations, and UI designs using Procreate. 
                I modeled the characters in Blender and integrated all visual assets into the game scenes 
                using Unity. Additionally, I edited the game’s opening animation (excluding sound design) 
                in After Effects.</p>
            <p> The original design of the boss character “Clown” featured an exaggeratedly long hat that 
                dragged on the ground, with the character walking hunched over using the two sharp corners 
                of the hat and its legs. During prototyping, the hat was shortened to reduce the complexity 
                and workload of costume physics and animation.</p>

            <p> Since we incorporated extensive background narrative design into our narrative 
                but lacked the time and assets to fully explain it within the gameplay, we created 
                a short paper-cut style animation as an introduction, helping players to quickly 
                immerse themselves in the game’s atmosphere. I was responsible for creating the 
                animation, with the exception of sound design.</p>

            <p> Despite the challenges and occasional stress, I truly enjoyed working on this 
                project. It was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of 
                game design and development workflows. I was fortunate to work with a strong and 
                collaborative team, where we developed effective teamwork, time management, and 
                problem-solving skills. Through the process, we also realized the importance of 
                finishing a basic idea before adding other big concept to it.</p>
