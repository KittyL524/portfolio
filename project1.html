            <h2 class="section-title">MY ROLE</h2>
            <p>In this project, my main role was to create visual assets, including character designs, scenes, 
                UI elements, and character animations. I also collaborated with my group members to develop a 
                strong and compelling storyline. Additionally, I was heavily involved in designing the gameplay 
                concepts and mechanics.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="concept">
            <h2 class="section-title">CONCEPT</h2>
            <p> "Immerself" is an adventure RPG developed in Unity. The story unfolds in a mysterious, 
                dark hospital where Theodore, the protagonist, awakens with partial memory loss. Guided 
                by a talking brain in a jar, he explore the hospital to reclaim his lost memories and 
                find a way out. As Theodore delves deeper, he faces choices that determine his encounters 
                with monsters named SearchLight and Nocturnal Sludge. He must decipher clues to find the 
                key and code necessary for escape.</p>
            <p> Throughout the hospital, Theodore discovers numerous news articles related to his past. 
                Ultimately, after gathering all the fragments, he uncovers the true nature of the world. 
                Developed using Unity, and we crafted most of the elements of the game ourselves.</p>
            <p> Our game centres around a core gameplay mechanic of light manipulation, serving both as 
                a navigational tool and a means of interacting with the world. This mechanic significantly 
                enhances the game's atmosphere. </p>

        <section id="process">
            <h2 class="section-title">PROCESS</h2>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <p> We initially designed a narrative-driven puzzle exploration game with three branching endings 
                based on player choices. As we developed multiple storyline paths, we realized that relying 
                solely on dialogue led to an overwhelming amount of text. To ease the cognitive load, I 
                implemented narrative clues through visual elements embedded in the scenes.</p>
            <p> Additionally, I learned the importance of establishing consistent relative sizing between 
                character sprites and scene objects before making a demo. Because this was not defined from 
                the start, we later spent significant time adjusting and replacing assets to maintain visual 
                coherence.</p>
            <div class="project-image-container">

            </div>

            <p><strong>Illustrate</strong></p>
            <p> I craeted the inital character draft in Proceate. I craeted the visual assets of sprites 
                and animtions by Aseprite. For character design, I created the "Light Bulb Monster,
                " an enemy concept closely tied to the game’s narrative. Drawing from the protagonist's 
                last scene before a car accident—an overexposed truck headlight—I combined light bulb and 
                eye motifs to symbolize the trauma embedded in the subconscious. The enemy was designed 
                with a humanoid head, incorporating bloodshot thread-like elements around the bulb to evoke 
                the image of bloodshot eyes, aligning with the game’s psychological horror theme.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
            <p> I enjoyed working on this project despite it being stressful and challenging. I learned a lot 
                in this project about game design and game work flow. I have a really good team in this project 
                that we make a good teamwork while we learned time management and problem solving. We know the 
                design should start from small idea based on our ability before develop it into a big idea.</p>
