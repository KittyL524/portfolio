            <h2 class="section-title">MY ROLE</h2>
            <p> In this project, my main role was to create visual assets, including the map, 
                UI elements, and game cards. I also collaborated with my team to design the economic 
                system and was responsible for organizing playtesting sessions and gathering feedback 
                to refine the gameplay.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="concept">
            <h2 class="section-title">CONCEPT</h2>
            <p> "Interastral Merchant" is a four-player game allows each player's ship a certain amount 
                of storage for loading ore samples or raw stone from different stations. Players can sell 
                the raw stone for money to carry out various actions and activities, such as mining or 
                exchanging. The game includes star routes consisting of a certain number of planets. 
                Players move between planets by piloting their ships with the distance traveled determined 
                by the number of dice thrown. During their movement, players will encounter various 
                events, some with positive outcomes and others negative. Players must decide on their 
                actions, choose routes, and strategize based on the resources they have.</p>
            <p> We designed this board game for ages 8 and up, catering to all genders. Our game appeals 
                to BrainHex’s Achiever, who enjoys achieving in-game objectives and goals by optimizing 
                strategies and resources. It also attracts BrainHex’s Mastermind, who delights in devising 
                strategies to overcome the challenge of collecting samples before any other player with 
                efficient decisions. Lastly, it engages BrainHex’s Socializer, who enjoys interacting with 
                others in games to probe their opponents' strategies and plan accordingly.</p>
            <p> It promotes strategic gameplay through its engaging mechanics, built 
                on the principles of accumulating, converting, crafting, and trading. These elements are 
                intertwined with core and secondary game mechanics to create a dynamic and immersive 
                experience. </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">PROCESS</h2>
            <p><strong>Design Choices</strong></p>
            <p> Interastral Merchant is designed with a resource-based economic system centered around 
                four key activities: accumulating, converting, crafting, and trading. Players collect 
                ores and samples through exploration and mining, convert resources into currency, and 
                strategically invest in items, upgrades, or additional mining opportunities. This system 
                encourages planning, risk assessment, and adaptive gameplay.</p>
            <p> To balance chance and strategy, we used randomized movement by dice, event outcomes, 
                and item draws—while allowing strategic mitigation through upgrades and card usage. 
                Multiple mining locations and flexible routing ensure no dominant path. We implemented 
                positive and negative feedback loops to reward smart investment such as upgrading storage 
                while avoiding runaway leads by imposing inventory trade-offs and resource limitations, 
                promoting both long-term planning and moment-to-moment decision-making.</p>

            </div>

            <p><strong>Visual Asset</strong></p>
            <p> I created the initial map layout in Procreate and, after team discussions, optimized 
                the number and arrangement of map grids to enhance the strategic depth of route selection. 
                Additionally, I designed various game cards—including resources, items, and currency—based 
                on the interstellar merchant theme and narrative of the board game.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
            <p> Working on Interastral Merchant was both challenging and rewarding, especially since 
                we only had about a month to complete it. Throughout the process, I got to dive into board 
                game design, from crafting mechanics and building an economic system to creating visual 
                assets. Collaborating with my team taught me how important time management, clear 
                communication, and problem-solving are when you're working under pressure. Even with 
                limited time, we managed to create a game that felt strategic, balanced, and visually 
                consistent. It was a tough but incredibly valuable experience that really grew my 
                understanding of game design.</p>
