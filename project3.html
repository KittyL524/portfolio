            <h2 class="section-title">MY ROLE</h2>
            <p>In this project, my main role was to create visual assets, including character designs, scenes, 
                UI elements, and character animations. I also collaborated with my group members to develop a 
                strong and compelling storyline. Additionally, I was heavily involved in designing the gameplay 
                concepts and mechanics.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="concept">
            <h2 class="section-title">CONCEPT</h2>
            <p> "Interastral Merchant" is a four-player game allows each player's ship a certain amount 
                of storage for loading ore samples or raw stone from different stations. Players can sell 
                the raw stone for money to carry out various actions and activities, such as mining or 
                exchanging. The game includes star routes consisting of a certain number of planets. 
                Players move between planets by piloting their ships with the distance traveled determined 
                by the number of dice thrown. During their movement, players will encounter various 
                events, some with positive outcomes and others negative. Players must decide on their 
                actions, choose routes, and strategize based on the resources they have.</p>
            <p> We designed this board game for ages 8 and up, catering to all genders. Our game appeals 
                to BrainHex’s Achiever, who enjoys achieving in-game objectives and goals by optimizing 
                strategies and resources. It also attracts BrainHex’s Mastermind, who delights in devising 
                strategies to overcome the challenge of collecting samples before any other player with 
                efficient decisions. Lastly, it engages BrainHex’s Socializer, who enjoys interacting with 
                others in games to probe their opponents' strategies and plan accordingly.</p>
            <p> It promotes strategic gameplay through its engaging mechanics, built 
                on the principles of accumulating, converting, crafting, and trading. These elements are 
                intertwined with core and secondary game mechanics to create a dynamic and immersive 
                experience. </p>

        <section id="process">
            <h2 class="section-title">PROCESS</h2>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <p> We initially designed a narrative-driven puzzle exploration game with three branching endings 
                based on player choices. As we developed multiple storyline paths, we realized that relying 
                solely on dialogue led to an overwhelming amount of text. To ease the cognitive load, I 
                implemented narrative clues through visual elements embedded in the scenes.</p>
            <p> Additionally, I learned the importance of establishing consistent relative sizing between 
                character sprites and scene objects before making a demo. Because this was not defined from 
                the start, we later spent significant time adjusting and replacing assets to maintain visual 
                coherence.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">narrative plot</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Visual Asset</strong></p>
            <p> I craeted the inital character draft in Proceate. I craeted the visual assets of sprites 
                and animtions by Aseprite. For character design, I created the "Light Bulb Monster,
                " an enemy concept closely tied to the game’s narrative. Drawing from the protagonist's 
                last scene before a car accident—an overexposed truck headlight—I combined light bulb and 
                eye motifs to symbolize the trauma embedded in the subconscious. The enemy was designed 
                with a humanoid head, incorporating bloodshot thread-like elements around the bulb to evoke 
                the image of bloodshot eyes, aligning with the game’s psychological horror theme.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
            <p> I enjoyed working on this project despite it being stressful and challenging. I learned a lot 
                in this project about game design and game work flow. I have a really good team in this project 
                that we make a good teamwork while we learned time management and problem solving. We know the 
                design should start from small idea based on our ability before develop it into a big idea.</p>
